# gould-k20

**Currently untested**

This is my project to create a reproduction probe for the Gould K20 logic analyzer and document the unit.

I did not get any probes with the unit, so I had to create my own one from scratch. 
The probe contains logic to route the three clock inputs to any combination of the three clocks on the analyzer. They can also be inverted and ORred together. All this is configured from the unit itself, and sent to a pair of shift registers in the probe.
